KOMIXNAVIGATOR README

KomixNavigator is a Java-based application for viewing a set of web comics by viewing their RSS feeds. There are many programs that access RSS feeds – Google Reader is one web-based example, and the most excellent of the lot, in my opinion – yet to this date there doesn’t seem to be one dedicated to viewing web comics.

The environment for the KomixNavigator is any computer with the latest Java installed.

Disk usage is approximately 12 KB for the application and more for the downloaded images.

The jar file consists of the following files:
    - MainReader.class and supporting classes – the GUI.
    - ComicFeed.class – handles all RSS feed information.
    - FileService.class – handles all file activities, including downloading images for viewing.
    - library.txt – a flat file for storing RSS feed info for your comic library.
    
Known Issues:
•	KomixNavigator does not load the list of entries properly. Entries can be selected from thin blank spaces above the date list.
•	Bugs with the list object will cause the program to crash when an entry date is selected.

Future improvements:
•	Tweak GUI.
•	Improved Comics List descriptions.
•	Ability to read any meta text that came with the image (xkcd always has that).
•	Ability to add feeds (must provide RSS feed link validation).
•	Add ability to mark favorite comics.
•	Save individual comics.
•	Keep track of date of last access and have option to only show the latest entries.
•	List comics by comic title or by all.
•	Caching image files to for quicker viewing.
•	Move to a database model (must include an import to db utility).
•	Import/export library list.
•	Browser-based?
